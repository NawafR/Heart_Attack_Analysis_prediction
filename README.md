# Heart Attack Analysis and Prediction

This project aims to predict the risk of heart attack based on several factors such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other characteristic attributes.

## Context:
<h5> Heart attack is a leading cause of death in most countries, along with stroke and cancer. It occurs when an artery supplying your heart with blood and oxygen becomes blocked. Fatty deposits build up over time, forming plaques in your heart's arteries. If a plaque ruptures, a blood clot can form and block your arteries, causing a heart attack. <h5>

<h4> This dataset contains information about people and their heart conditions. <h4>

## Data

The data used in this project is sourced from the [Heart Disease UCI dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease). The dataset contains 303 instances and 14 attributes.

## Methodology

The project uses Random Forest, KNN, SVC and Naive  to predict the risk of heart attack. 

## Results

The best model achieved an accuracy of 89% on the test set.
